[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eishan05/dizbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eishan05/dizbot)

A command line tool to seemlessly build discord bots in python

## How to use

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

The command `dizbot run` walks you through creating a bot. It saves the bot conifguration on file, and reads it the next time you run the command!

## How to install (temporary)
1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual python environment (optional but recommended)
3. Run `pip install --editable .`
